		<p>The Canal Recreation Project<p/>
        <img src="images/canal_recreation/canal_recreation.jpg" alt="The canal recreation project"/>
        <p>The assignment was to investigate the canal between Eindhoven and Helmond and create new recreation there. The recreation should focus on
        ten minute recreation, three to four hours activities and a weekend long recreation.
        The first part of the assignment was to investigate different subjects related to the canal. I researched the recreation that is associated
        with thecanal. I went along the canal and counted the number of different activities over several days and talked to people about how they enjoyed
        the canal. The results I mapped in a number different maps.</p>
        <p>The next step was to develop an idea for new recreation along the canal. The concepts that I based my system of recreation upon were the linear
        character of the canal combined with the rhythm of the bridges. A bike path and a footpath run along the length of the canal but the canal is very
        disconnected from the surroundings. The only real connections with the surrounding landscape are at the bridges where the roads cross the canal. I
        would use bridges to house the different activities.</p>
        <p>The canal runs from almost the city centre through an industrial area and through peaceful forests to Helmond. This, together with the line and the
        rhythm suggested to me a (mental) journey. So I chose to make a meditation retreat in the peace of the forest for my weekend recreation.
        One of the findings of the first research part of the assignment was that the Campina factory next to the canal cleaned the canal. The factory was
        pumping up groundwater for cooling water that the factory afterwards released into the canal. This water is very clean and insured a high water quality
        in the canal. The factory wants to stop this way of cooling but legislation forbids it to make any changes that influence the water quality. So my
        second idea for recreation was a sauna that uses this clean water. Often saunas are combined with cold baths and as the sauna will be a bridge over
        the canal the canal can function as the cold bath.
        The third, ten-minute recreation I placed at the beginning of the canal, in the city. This is a fountain square that spans the canal. Here people can
        get wet, play in shallow pools, run through the jets of water. Here again the water of the canal can be used to feed the fountains that will oxygenate
        the water before giving it back to the canal.</p>
