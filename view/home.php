This is my online portfolio</br>

Here I would like to show you</br>
How I think,</br>
How I work</br>
And what I do.</br></br>

<p>
You may have noticed I dislike style for the sake of style.
I Like to keep my eye on the bigger picture and to get to the core of the issue.
This makes me a designer with a strong conceptual approach.
</p>

<p>
In a portfolio it is important to show your products and concepts
but I think it is more important to show your way of thinking.
Therefore I have organised my portfolio according to the way I approached the assignments, how I thought about them.
Under each tagword on the left you will find the projects associated with the different approaches.
As I am still a student at the Design Academy Eindhoven almost all the work here is work I made for assignments for the academy.
